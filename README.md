# kubench

The goal of Kubench is to make it easy to run benchmark jobs on [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) with various system and model settings.

Kubench enables benchmarks by leveraging Kubeflow's capability of managing TFJobs(/PyTorchJobs/etc.), as well as [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) based workflows. Kubench is provided as a Ksonnet package.
